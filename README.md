CAPYBARA + AI + API + Bad spelling

## Why Capybara?

Well you have to have a theme, design or some sort of mascot just because, you know? Why not should be the right reason.

And Capybaras are pretty chill, hanging out with jaguars, crocs, deer, cows, humans, anything, which is what i hope this piece of software does, it should work well with all AI API providers.
